A discord bot I develop for myself when I'm bored!

Features are limited, because I did not make this to be a proper multi-purpose bot. This project merely serves to provide my friends and I some features that we want from a Discord bot. In addition, this is also serving as a way for me to learn more about JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Features

- Full integration of Discord's application commands, all commands are ran using either a slash or through the context menu.
- Can play any videos from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), as well as music from either [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com).
- Basic infractions system (Currently limited to warnings).

## Database
